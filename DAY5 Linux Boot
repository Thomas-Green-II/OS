----------------------------------------------------------LINUX BOOT PROCESS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look at the FG for chart on Boot Process


- BIOS - Basic Input Output System, Loads and runs the boot loader
- MBR - Master Boot Record
- GRUB - Grand unified Bootloader
       - Config File is /boot/grub/men.lst
       - boot/grub/grub.cfg
       - os selection screen where if no choice is made, default kernel specified in the grub configuration file (boot/grub/grub.cfg)
- Kernel - Initializes the devices and its drivers, mounts the root filesystem, PID 0, starts init with a PID of 1
         - Manages interactions between OS and Hardware
         - Has modules = Extensions that allow the kernel to communicate to Hardware
         - Mounts the root '/' filesystem
- Init - Sets the rest of the system processes in motion using pre-conigured runlevels
       - /sbin/init is hardcoded for backwards compatability
       - /etc/inittab is the configuration file for init
       - Service and process manager
       - The entire startup proccess is handled by /etc/init.d
          - Scripts that ruun 'S'tart and 'K'ill scripts out of applicable rc folders
- RunLevels - Software Configuration where only a select group of processes exist
          0 - Halt
          1 - Single User
          2 - Multi User - Without netwroking
          3 - Multi User - Networking
          4 - Multi User - Custom Configurations
          5 - Multi User - Networking and GUI
          6 - reboot

COMMANDS

df -h   <----- Command to find all the disks

sudo xxd -l 512 -g 1 /dev/sda   <------ Gets the hex of a disk file
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=MBRcopy bs=1 count=512     <------ copy 512 bytes of the disk file to a new file called MBRcopy
file MBRcopy <------ ensure it is a DOS/MBR boot sector

cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg  <----- to see the grub file

lsmod <----- list kernel modules

ls -l /sbin/init    <----- determines which init system you are using
ps -p1   <------ determines which init system you are using

cat /etc/inittab   <----- check system init config (SysV only)

A Partition is 16 bytes
