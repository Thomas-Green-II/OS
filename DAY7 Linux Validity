Bracketed processes are kernel processes (IE [kthreadd])

Kernel space processes have acces to everything, and share memory; if it dies it could break your system
User space processes do not share memory an therefor if one dies your system will be okay

Effective user ID (euid) <----- defines the access rights for a process.
Real user ID (ruid), indicates who initiated a process, defines the user that can interact with the running process—most significantly
Users can only modify / interact with files /process that they own or have been shared with them.

System Call <---- interaction between a process and the kernel
System calls used for process startup:
fork() When a process calls fork(), the kernel creates a nearly identical copy of the process.
exec() When a process calls exec(program), the kernel starts program, replacing the current process.

ls example 
shell  ----> fork()  -----> shell
                         |
                          -> copy of shell -----> exec(ls)  ----> ls
                          

Capital CRON signifies there is a cronjob running
Cron jobs are a standard method of scheduling tasks to run on your server
The cron daemon checks three directories every minute nd executes and commands needed to be run:
/var/spool/cron   (User cron jobs)
/etc/cron.d
/etc/crontab    (System cron jobs)
crontab jobs run with the permissions of the owner of the crontab file

Another way to check for reoccuring events is to check for timers


orphan process   <-----  process that had a parent process that dies, but was adopted by Systemd or init
Every daemon is an orphan, nt every orphan is a daemon
(Daemons are background processes/services)

zombie proces <----- completed process, but still has an entry in the process table, waiting on parent to acknowledge or terminate
Can't be killed unless the parent process is killed

After viewing the processes, each process has a single letter in the S(State) field;
S - Sleeping Process
R - Running Process
Z - Zombie Process

Malicious processes are sometimes orphaned and named to make it look like a daemon process:
‘ps --ppid 1 -lf'


Socket <----- IP and a port 


---------------------------------------------------------COMMANDS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ps -elf <------ shows every (e) process as a snapshot 

ps -Nlf --ppid 2  <----- any process that does Not (N) have the parent process id of 2
ps -Nlf -ppid 2 --forest <----- shows process trees for processes that don't have the parent process id of 2
ps -Nlf --ppid 2 --forest | grep -B # ps   <-------- Use the -B for before to see the # of lines before your search 
ps -Nlf --ppid 2 --forest | grep -A # ps   <-------- Use the -A for after to see the # of lines after your search 
ps -Nlf --ppid 2 --forest | grep --context # ps <------- use the --context for before and after to see the # of lines around your search

kill -9 <PID>’ or ‘pkill -9 <process name>’

top   <------ Shows an active list of processes
use the spacebar to select other fields you want to be included and use the escape key to actually use them
shift V gives the tree view of the processes

htop - needs to be installed to use
shows cpus
press f5 to change it to tree view
to add fields, press f2 and select columns
press f10 to finalize your setup

‘ps --ppid 1 -lf' <-------- See all orphaned processes

disown -a && exit <------ Close a shell/terminal and force all children to be adopted

jobs  <---- Display List of Jobs running in the background
kill %<job number> <---  Terminate the process by job number

kill -l  <----- list all the kill signals that can be sent

crontab  <------ create user cron jobs
crontab -e  <----- edit cron jobs
crontab -l  <---- list cron jobs
crontab -lu <---- list other users jobs
sudo crontab -e -u <---- edit other peoples cron jobs
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/ <----- check the file with the user's username for their specific cron jobs

la /proc   <---- gets all the processes and their PIDs 
la/proc/18880  <----- look at the whats linked to the process with the PID of 18880

lsof <---- lists all the open files for processes on the system
sudo lsof -p 18880 <---- look at all the files that are open for your ssh process
only worry about the numbered file descriptors;
 - file descriptor 0-2, in,out,error
sudo lsof -c sshd <---- look at the process via name rather than PID
 
 systemctl list-units --all --type timer  <----- check for timers
 systemctl list-units --all --type services <---- list all services
