Bracketed processes are kernel processes (IE [kthreadd])

Kernel space processes have acces to everything, and share memory; if it dies it could break your system
User space processes do not share memory an therefor if one dies your system will be okay

Effective user ID (euid) <----- defines the access rights for a process.
Real user ID (ruid), indicates who initiated a process, defines the user that can interact with the running processâ€”most significantly
Users can only modify / interact with files /process that they own or have been shared with them.




---------------------------------------------------------COMMANDS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ps -elf <------ shows every (e) process as a snapshot 

ps -Nlf --ppid 2  <----- any process that does Not (N) have the parent process id of 2
ps -Nlf -ppid 2 --forest <----- shows process trees for processes that don't have the parent process id of 2
ps -Nlf --ppid 2 --forest | grep -B # ps   <-------- Use the -B for before to see the # of lines before your search 
ps -Nlf --ppid 2 --forest | grep -A # ps   <-------- Use the -A for after to see the # of lines after your search 
ps -Nlf --ppid 2 --forest | grep --context # ps <------- use the --context for before and after to see the # of lines around your search

top   <------ Shows an active list of processes
use the spacebar to select other fields you want to be included and use the escape key to actually use them
shift V gives the tree view of the processes

htop - needs to be installed to use
shows cpus
press f5 to change it to tree view
to add fields, press f2 and select columns
press f10 to finalize your setup
