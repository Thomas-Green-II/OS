/lib = functions that are needed for applications to run and operate correctly
/mnt = dedicated directory for external storage
/media = removable media
/opt = reservation for any file or applications that you install yourself as the user
/run = run time and variable data, mounted at boot, holds information to that session of the computer running
/tmp = temporary files, everyone has access, but only used for temporary persistence
