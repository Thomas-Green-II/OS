A process is a program that executes

dll injection - Not stored on a disk, but it is strored in memory


------------------------------------------------Process Validitty-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Used to find out if the processes running on the machine are the same ones that the binary called, are they legit processes?

Process <------- requires interaction to execute
Service <------- Runs on the background quietly 
DLL     <------- Library that contains pointers to resources available for other programs to interact with. Happen when you manipulate handles

C:\Windows\System32 <------- Where the system processes and services normally run from

command line is the arguments being passed to service host telling it to launch the service by its service name not its display name
if svchost -k is present it is a legit service, 99% of the time

Get-Process | Select Name, Id, Path
Get-Ciminstance Win32_service | Select Name, Processid, Pathname

How do we discover Normal, abnormal, and Hidden Processes and Services?
Get-Process SMSS,CSRSS,LSASS | Sort -Property Id

See the handles
get-process -Name lsass | select -ExpandProperty modules | out-file $home\desktop\handles.txt -width 4096
get-process -Name lsass | select -ExpandProperty modules | format-table -wrap    <---- what are the handles for lsass
get-ciminstance win32_process | where {$_.Name -like "*LSASS*"} | Select *

Do boot processes have descriptions?
Get-Process | Select Name, Id, Description | Sort -Property Id

Are Priority Levels of processes important?
Get-Process | Select Name, Priorityclass
Tasklist /m
